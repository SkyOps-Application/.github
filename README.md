# SkyOps

**SkyOps** is an air traffic control (ATC) training simulator developed as a final academic project at EPITA.  
The project aims to make air traffic control practice more accessible, interactive, and educational, using modern technologies on both web and iPadOS platforms.

SkyOps is designed for:
- Aviation students who want to practice ATC concepts outside of traditional laboratories.
- Aviation enthusiasts and younger learners who wish to discover and explore air traffic control operations.

---

## Project Overview

SkyOps simulates an en-route air traffic control environment where users can:
- Monitor aircraft movements on a radar-style map
- Manage flight routes, waypoints, and airspace structure
- Issue air traffic control clearances (altitude, heading, speed, direct-to)
- Detect and resolve loss-of-separation situations
- Replay training sessions for learning and review

The project focuses on **realistic logic** rather than full real-world operational accuracy, making it suitable for education and training purposes.
